I have broad research interests ranging from molecular biology and botany to
computer science and mathematics.

## Currently

I am currently engaged in research projects related to systems biology, soil
microbiome and bioinformatics.

## As master student

My master thesis consisted mainly in studying network motifs in gene
regulatory networks able to produce cell differentiation.

## As undergraduate student

During my time as undergraduate student I worked in "wet lab" research related
to infectious diseases in the Biolog√≠a y Control de Enfermedades Infecciosas
(BCEI) lab. I worked mainly with vector competence of the mosquito
*Aedes aegypti* and its interactions with Dengue Virus and Chikungunya Virus.
I worked a lot with cell cultures and plaque assays.
